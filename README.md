### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Start in the IT field as support, buy a lot of experience in network infrastructure, server administration and Linux. It was a gateway, but it wasn't, that I was aiming for my professional career. I have always dreamed of working with development, both front-end and back-end. After some courses and projects that develop, I fell in love with front-end and javascript. From that moment on, start focusing or learning on VueJS, as it is also possible to get my first job as a Web developer using this technology. It is still a full stack developer, but before that, my goal is to dominate or front-end with VueJS and javascript.
